# Welcome to my BIOF 309 Project.

I have been a distance runner since January 2009 and have logged every one of my runs from January 1st, 2010, to the present. In that time I have completed 10 seasons of cross country running (1 middle school, 4 high school, 4 college, 1 post-collegiate) and 5 seasons of distance running for track and field (1 high school, 4 college). For the majority of the past ten years, I have run between 5 and 7 times a week. I have competed in well over 150 races, and have spent some time doing basic analyses on my times in these races, but up to the present I have never analyzed my day-to-day runs.

Since it is the end of a decade, I was motivated to compile all my runs from the physical running logs in which I have kept track of each run's distance and time, so that I could look back on my accomplishments throughout the 2010s. I believe that in the absence of any present data to analyze from my lab, my running data offers me an excellent opportunity to learn basic Python code and troubleshoot in Python as I do these analyses (which I think is the best way to learn a coding language). My primary goal of this project, apart from finding interesting trends in my running career, is to learn how to do in Python a lot of the things I know how to do in R. This entails data management, visualization, and analysis.
